# JavaScript

## Overview
This course laid the groundwork for my journey into web development.  
Through hands-on projects, I learned to structure with HTML, style with CSS, and bring life to interfaces using JavaScript.  
Building a Tic Tac Toe game, calculator, and pizza menu made abstract concepts click.

Each assignment reinforced the core tools of the web and built my confidence through real problem-solving.  
JavaScript stood out as a vital tool for creating interactive, user-friendly applications.  
Its role in modern frameworks like React or Vue makes it a must-know language.

In my career path as a web or software developer, JavaScript's flexibility and power will be indispensable.  
The course also sharpened my skills in debugging, logic, and UI design.  
Watching my ideas turn into functional, responsive websites was incredibly satisfying.

Most importantly, I walked away with a portfolio, hands-on experience, and the confidence to build more.  
This course wasn’t just theory — it was practical, project-based, and empowering.  
It gave me the solid foundation I need to grow as a developer.
